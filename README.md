# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets
This project uses an LSTM to distinguish between positive, negative, neutral, and other tweets.

The project is currenly needing different tweet data. If you look at the EDA within my main.ipynb file, you will see that the data is poorly labeled. I couldn't find an alternative so I made the model infrastructure and plan on coming back with better data in the future.

# Future Developments:
I plan to build on this project by including Intent analysis which would include whether their tweet was a query, news, promotion, opinion, suggestion, or complaint.
Past this I plan on adding self-attention to the model just to get a feel for how that works.
